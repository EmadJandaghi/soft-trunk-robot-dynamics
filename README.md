# Soft Trunk Robot Dynamics and Fault Detection

This repository contains the code for the paper *"Motion Dynamics Modeling and Fault Detection of a Soft Trunk Robot"* by Emadodin Jandaghi, Xiaotian Chen, and Chengzhi Yuan. The project implements a machine learning approach using deterministic learning and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) to model the dynamics of a soft trunk robot and detect faults.
